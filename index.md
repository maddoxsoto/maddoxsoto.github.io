### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was a very interesting task to take on because I enjoy both coding and blackjack.
    Seeing some of my unlikely interests collide on a school assignment made it more engaging and made me want to complete it more.
    My partner for the assignment was also very helpful and the task felt way more fun.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 hilo was another one of my favorites because the game that I was coding actually seemed
    somewhat fun. I was interested in coding it and was excited for the result to work in the end. Along with
    my partner doing his part 1 in the assignment I felt like the workload was much lighter when the split work was in trusted hands.

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was one of my favorites because of how simple and easy it was. It also marked the start of my journey into computer science.
    I feel that it is an important milestone even if it is just as simple as hello world. The value and meaning this message will hold
    later on in my career will be so amazing.
